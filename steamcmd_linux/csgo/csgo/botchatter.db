// BotChatter.db
// Author: Michael S. Booth, Turtle Rock Studios (www.turtlerockstudios.com)
//
// This database defines "Places" (phrases that describe a location in the world)
// and "Chatter" (phrases used for everything else) the bots use to talk via their radio.
// 
// Phrases (ie: either Place or Chatter) can contain any number of wav filenames that
// contain voice recordings saying something appropriate for that phrase's concept.
// For instance, the Chatter entry for "Affirmative" contains several wav files saying
// things that mean "yes", such as "affirmative", "yes sir", "roger that", and so on.
//
// Some phrases have a "Radio" line. This maps that phrase to a Standard Radio event and
// is used when the player has restricted the bots to only using Standard Radio messages.
// In that case, that radio message will be played instead of the normal phrase.
//
// The keyword "Important" flags that phrase as being "mission critical", and means it
// will be spoken if the player has set the bots to "minimal" chatter.
//
// "Count" and "Place" qualifiers mean that any subsequent wav files will only be selected
// if the bot is referring to the given Count or Place.
//
//
// VOICE ACTOR NOTES:
// Unless otherwise stated, these phrases should be spoken in a terse, matter-of-fact manner.
// The bots will utter "batches" of phrases to communicate the situation. For example, if a bot
// discovers many enemies near the bridge, and one of them is carrying the bomb, he will say
// something like:
//   "Bridge" ... "There's the bomber" ... "Need help!"
